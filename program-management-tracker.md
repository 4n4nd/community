**Workstream** | **Status** | **Notes**
---------------|------------|----------
[Attracting users](1) | YELLOW | Open source dev intake needs work; SRE concepts learning path needed; improvement blocked on website changes
Messaging | CHARTREUSE | Needs community mailing list discussions and decision to finalize
Website changes | YELLOW | Info arch is designed; need to build out the new layout
Contributor experience | YELLOW | New contributor experience is rough and confusing; Community Handbook effort should help but we are blocked on the mailing list discussion and consensus to use the Community Handbook approach
Governance | RED | No work done on this, very important work start soon. Blocked on community mailing list.
Metrics plan | YELLOW | We have a baseline but don't know what questions we want to ask. We need to work on this soon before we start serious efforts to attract users and contributors.
Documentation plan | YELLLOW | Project overall has the right idea, the Community Handbook should help a lot. User documentation needs organizing, gap analysis, and a plan.
Marketing plan | CHARTREUSE | Needs to be converted entirely into a community document and see the project board is filled properly with all the aspects
Infrastructure (visibility, resources) | CHARTREUSE | All there, more visibility; more hardware needed but coming soon.
Learning paths | GREEN | A lot of internal alignment happening, will be looking to start SRE community of practice at OI Labs soon
